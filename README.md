## Hello, world!

I've worked with quantum information since my master's degree. In my master's degree, I worked with quantum cryptography which led me to seek more practical applications of quantum mechanics. My ph.D. is centered around quantum walks where I seek to characterize what conditions graphs must obey to achieve certain phenomena like state transfer.
