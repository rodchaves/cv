## Hello, world!

I've worked with quantum information since my master's degree. In my master's degree, I worked with quantum cryptography which led me to seek more practical applications of quantum mechanics. My ph.D. is centered around quantum walks where I seek to characterize what conditions graphs must obey to achieve certain phenomena like state transfer.

### Education:

* Ph.D. candidate at Federal University of Minas Gerais, Computer Science: 2018-Present
  * Quantum walks and quantum computation, supervised by [Gabriel Coutinho](https://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~gabriel/)
* M. Sc. at Federal Univeristy of Minas Gerais, Physics: 2016-2018
  * Using quantum state discrimination strategies to attack quantum-key distribution protocols, supervised by [Leonardo Neves](http://lattes.cnpq.br/0525343899407081)
* B.Sc. at Federal University of Minas Gerais, Physics: 2011-2016
